# Portfolio
Hi,

Welcome to my coding portfolio! Here I have provided you with some of the code that I have developed in my roles as a Research Data Science intern at Sequoia Foundation and as a graduate student instructor for a data visualization course at the University of California, Berkeley.

Best Regards,
Ilya Moskalenko
