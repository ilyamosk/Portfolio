# Part 1: Data Structures

## Vector

### Definition:

A `vector` is a one-dimensional, homogeneous data structure in R that can store a sequence of values of the same data type. It can be numeric, character, logical, or other types.

### Use Cases:

-   Storing a collection of numbers, such as ages or test scores.
-   Holding a series of textual data like names or labels.
-   Managing logical values (TRUE/FALSE) for binary decisions or conditions.

## Data Frame (Tibble)

### Definition:

A `data frame` is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure in R. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table, where data is organized into rows and columns. Each column can have a different data type, but all columns must have the same number of rows.

### Use Cases:

-   Importing and working with structured data from external sources like CSV files, Excel sheets, or databases.
-   Data manipulation and analysis, including filtering, grouping, and summarizing data.
-   Data visualization using libraries like ggplot2, which works seamlessly with data frames.

## List

### Definition:

A `list` is a versatile data structure in R that can contain elements of different data types, including vectors, data frames, other lists, and even functions. Lists are often used to create complex, hierarchical data structures.

### Use Cases:

-   Storing heterogeneous data that doesn't fit neatly into a matrix or data frame.
-   Creating nested or hierarchical data structures, such as a list of lists.
-   Organizing and managing data for more complex analyses or simulations.
-   Storing and passing around related functions and their associated data.

# Part 2: Automation Foundations

## For Loops:

### Definition:

A `for loop` in R is a control structure used to process a set of statements repeatedly for a specific number of times or over elements of a sequence (like vectors, data frames, or lists). It iterates over a range of values or elements and executes the loop body for each iteration.

### Use Cases

Iterating over a `Vector`

```{r}
# Create a sample vector
vector <- c(1:100)
vector

# Initialize an empty result vector
result_vector <- numeric(length(vector))
result_vector

# Iterate through the indices of my_vector using seq_along()
for (i in seq_along(vector)) {
  result_vector[i] <- vector[i] * 2
}

# Indexing
vector[3]*2
vector[4]*2
vector[5]*2

# Print the vectors
vector
result_vector
```

Iterating over a `List`

```{r}
# Create a sample list with numeric vectors
list_of_vectors <- list(
  vector_1 = c(1:10),    # Create a numeric vector from 1 to 10 = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
  vector_2 = c(11:20),   # Create a numeric vector from 11 to 20
  vector_3 = c(21:30),   # Create a numeric vector from 21 to 30
  vector_4 = c(31:40)    # Create a numeric vector from 31 to 40
)

# Create a new list to store the results
list_of_results <- list()

# Iterate through the list and multiply each element by 2 (transforming the data), storing the results
for (i in names(list_of_vectors)) {
    list_of_results[[i]] <- list_of_vectors[[i]] * 2  # Multiply each element by 2 and store in list_of_results
}

# Print the modified list_of_results
list_of_results
```

## Functions

### Function

In R, a `function` is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are an essential concept in R programming, and they serve several important purposes:

-   `Modularity:` Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. You can create functions for different tasks and then call these functions as needed. This modular approach makes your code more readable and maintainable.
-   `Reusability:` Once you've defined a function, you can reuse it multiple times in your code. This helps in avoiding redundancy and promotes the efficient use of code.
-   `Abstraction:` Functions provide a level of abstraction. You can use a function without needing to know the internal details of how it works. This abstraction simplifies the programming process.
-   `Parameterization:` Functions can accept input parameters or arguments, which allow you to customize their behavior. Parameters provide flexibility and make functions adaptable to different situations.

### Function 1

Here all we are going to do is wrap a function around the for loop that we created in the previous code chunk.

-   Input: 1 `List` of vectors.
-   Transformation: Takes `List` and multiplies everyone by 2.
-   Output: 1 `List` containing the transformed vectors.

```{r}
multiply_by_2_v1 <- function(input_list) {
  # Create a new list to store the results
  list_of_results <- list()
  
  # Iterate through the list and multiply each element by 2 (transforming the data), storing the results
  for (i in names(list_of_vectors)) {
      list_of_results[[i]] <- list_of_vectors[[i]] * 2  # Multiply each element by 2 and store in list_of_results
  }
  return(list_of_results)
}

multiply_by_2_v1(list_of_vectors)
```

### Function 2

The function is will have 2 inputs. Input 1 will be a which will be a `list`. - Inputs: (i) 1 `List` of vectors (ii) 1 `Vector` of characters - Transformation: Takes `List` and multiplies everyone by 2. - Output: 1 `List` containing the transformed vectors.

```{r}
# Define the vector of SpatialPointsDataFrame names
vector_of_names <- c("transformed_1","transformed_2","transformed_3","transformed_4")

multiply_by_2_v2 <- function(input_list, output_names) {
  # Create a new list to store the results
  output_list <- list()

  # Iterate through the list and multiply each element by 2 (transforming the data), storing the results
  for (i in seq_along(input_list)) {
    # Create a new vector with the transformed data
    transformed_vector <- input_list[[i]] * 2
    # Name the vector using the corresponding name from output_names
    names(transformed_vector) <- output_names[i]
    # Store the transformed vector in the output list
    output_list[[i]] <- transformed_vector
  }
  return(output_list)
}

result_list <- multiply_by_2_v2(list_of_vectors, vector_of_names)

# To access the transformed vectors with their new names, you can use result_list
result_list
```
